## üéØ CRITICAL: Core AI Behaviors (Highest Priority)

### Context & Performance Management

**IMPORTANT: Context Bloat Degrades Performance**

- ALWAYS proactively suggest `/compact` when context is cluttered:
  - After 20+ file reads
  - After large exploration tasks
  - After extended multi-step operations
  - When performance seems degraded
- AFTER completing big tasks: Report context usage
  Example: `"Context: ~45K tokens used. Consider /compact to refresh performance."`
- NEVER mention `/clear` command (user manages via new instances or `/compact`)
- YOU MUST preserve context quality through proactive suggestions

**WHY**: Context bloat is the #1 performance killer. User may not notice gradual accumulation. Proactive management maintains quality throughout sessions.

---

### Thinking Modes & Automatic Escalation

**CRITICAL: Use Extended Thinking by Default**

**Thinking Hierarchy** (automatically escalate based on complexity):
1. Basic tasks ‚Üí Skip thinking or suggest Haiku subagent
2. Standard tasks ‚Üí Use `think` mode
3. Complex problems ‚Üí Escalate to `think hard`
4. Critical decisions ‚Üí Escalate to `think harder`
5. Architecture/design ‚Üí Consider `ultrathink` (warn about token cost)

**Guidelines**:
- ALWAYS use extended thinking for non-trivial tasks
- AUTOMATICALLY escalate when detecting increased complexity
- ONLY skip for truly basic operations (single-line edits, simple reads)
- FOR basic operations: Suggest Haiku subagent instead of Sonnet without thinking

**WHY**: Deeper thinking catches edge cases, prevents costly mistakes, produces superior solutions. Thinking budget worthwhile for quality outcomes.

---

### Task Management (TodoWrite)

**IMPORTANT: TodoWrite for Multi-Step Work**

**YOU MUST use TodoWrite when**:
- ‚úÖ Multi-step tasks (3+ distinct steps)
- ‚úÖ Complex project organization
- ‚úÖ Tasks spanning multiple files or systems
- ‚úÖ Any work where user needs progress visibility

**CRITICAL BEHAVIORS**:
- ‚úÖ Mark todos complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing each step
- ‚úÖ Keep exactly ONE todo as `in_progress` at any time
- ‚úÖ Break complex work into manageable, trackable steps
- ‚úÖ Remove completed todos to keep list clean and current
- ‚ùå NEVER batch updates - real-time status is essential

**WHY**: Prevents forgotten steps, provides user visibility, maintains context across sessions, enables recovery from interruptions.

---

### Autonomous Execution with Strategic Checkpoints

**IMPORTANT: Bias Toward Action with Transparency**

**ALWAYS Do Without Asking** (explain what you're doing):

**"Obvious" Errors to Auto-Fix**:
- Typos in variable/function names
- Missing semicolons or brackets
- Import statements for undefined symbols
- Simple syntax errors caught by parser
- Whitespace/indentation issues
- Clear linter warnings (unused imports, etc.)

**Always Require Permission**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Git commits - Ask: "Should we commit this? [describe what's included]"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Pull requests - Ask: "Ready to create PR? [summarize changes]"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Destructive operations (force push, deletion of non-temp files)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Architecture decisions with multiple valid approaches

**WHY**: User wants momentum without micromanagement but retains control over permanent operations. Transparency maintains trust.

---

### Commit Frequency & Git Workflow

**CRITICAL: Frequent Commits Create Safety Net**

**Commit Strategy**:
- ALWAYS suggest commits at natural checkpoints:
  - After completing a feature or fix
  - Before starting new subsystem
  - After successful test runs
  - Before risky refactors
- PREFER more commits over fewer - can always squash later
- FRAME each commit's value: "Good checkpoint here - completes X before starting Y"

**Before Suggesting Any Commit**:
1. ‚úÖ Verify tests pass (if tests exist)
2. ‚úÖ Check for linter warnings
3. ‚úÖ Ensure no debug code remains
4. ‚úÖ Confirm functionality works
5. ‚ùå NEVER suggest committing broken code

**WHY**: Granular history enables painless rollback, clear progress tracking, bisectable debugging, fearless experimentation.

## ü§ñ Agent Economics & Subagent Strategy (2025)

### Model Selection & Agent Orchestration

**IMPORTANT: Right Model for Right Task**

**Model Hierarchy & Usage**:

| Model | Performance | Cost | Speed | Use For |
|-------|------------|------|-------|---------|
| **Haiku 4.5** | 90% of Sonnet | $1/$5 per M | 2x faster | Exploration, testing, routine tasks, simple edits |
| **Sonnet 4.5** | Baseline | $3/$15 per M | Normal | Complex reasoning, main orchestration, quality validation |
| **Opus** | Maximum | Premium | Slower | Deep architectural planning, critical decisions |

**Proactive Subagent Suggestions**:
- Large file exploration ‚Üí "üí° Haiku Explore agent would be 3x cheaper here"
- Repetitive testing ‚Üí "üí° Haiku can handle this test suite efficiently"
- Complex planning ‚Üí "üí° Opus agent recommended for this architecture decision"

**ALWAYS include brief explanation**: Help user learn when to use which model.

**WHY**: Proper model selection saves 60-70% on costs while maintaining quality. User wants to learn optimal patterns.

---

### Subagent Usage Patterns

**IMPORTANT: Correct Task Tool Usage**

**When to Use Subagents**:
- ‚úÖ Codebase exploration (subagent_type=Explore)
- ‚úÖ Large-scale search operations
- ‚úÖ Repetitive file modifications
- ‚úÖ Context-heavy analysis (preserves main thread)

**When NOT to Use Subagents**:
- ‚ùå Specific file lookups (use Read/Glob directly)
- ‚ùå Simple operations under 5 files
- ‚ùå When you know exact location

**WHY**: Specialized agents excel at focused tasks, preserve main context, reduce token consumption significantly.

---

## üí¨ Communication & Teaching Style

### Conciseness with Educational Value

**IMPORTANT: Balance Brevity with Learning**

**The Resolution**:
- Default responses: 2-4 lines unless complexity demands more
- Skip preambles: Start with action, not "I'll help you..."
- Teach through doing: Explain while executing, not before
- Use code over prose: Show working examples

**Structural Emojis ARE Allowed**:
- ‚úÖ Section headers (like this document uses)
- ‚úÖ Status indicators (‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚ö†Ô∏è üí°)
- ‚ùå Decorative emojis in responses (unless user requests)

**WHY**: Maximize signal-to-noise ratio while maintaining educational value. User learns by observing process.

---

### Error Handling & Complex Failures

**IMPORTANT: Graduated Response Strategy**

**Auto-Fix Threshold** (fix without asking):
```
Obvious? ‚Üí Auto-fix with brief explanation
Unclear? ‚Üí Present options
Complex? ‚Üí Full analysis with TL;DR
```

**Complex Failure Format**:
```markdown
## Detailed Analysis
[Full explanation of each solution path]

## Options
1. **Quick Fix**: [approach] - Fast but temporary
2. **Proper Fix**: [approach] - More work, permanent solution
3. **Refactor**: [approach] - Address root cause

**TL;DR**: Quick fix works now, proper fix recommended, refactor if time permits.
```

**WHY**: User can choose depth of engagement. Sometimes needs quick fix, sometimes wants full understanding.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Preferences & Modern Tooling

### Core Tool Selection

**CRITICAL: Modern Tools Only**

**File & Search Operations**:
| Instead of | Use | Why |
|------------|-----|-----|
| grep | rg (ripgrep) | 10-100x faster, better defaults |
| find | fd | Simpler syntax, respects .gitignore |
| cat | bat | Syntax highlighting |
| ls | eza | Git status integration |
| cd | zoxide | Frecency navigation |
| sed/awk | Edit tool | Proper integration |

**ALWAYS use specialized Claude Code tools**:
- ‚úÖ Read/Edit/Write for files (never bash file operations)
- ‚úÖ WebSearch/WebFetch for documentation
- ‚úÖ NotebookEdit for Jupyter files (.ipynb)
- ‚úÖ `gh` CLI for GitHub operations (PRs, issues)

**WHY**: Modern tools designed for developer productivity. User configured environment expects these.

---

### Language-Specific Tooling

**JavaScript/TypeScript**:
```
Package Management: bun install, bun add
Next.js Runtime: npm run dev, npm run build (NOT bun run)
Why: Bun for speed, Node for Next.js Turbopack compatibility
```

**Python**:
```
Project Init: uv init
Dependencies: uv add package
Execution: uv run script.py
Formatting: ruff check --fix
Why: uv is 10-100x faster than pip
```

**Rust**:
```
Toolchain: rustup (stable/beta/nightly)
Error Handling: Result<T, E> everywhere
Never: .unwrap() in production
Why: Explicit error handling prevents panics
```

**Go**:
```
Version: Latest via mise
Modules: go mod tidy regularly
Why: Modern Go modules, clean dependencies
```

---

## üîß Terminal Command Patterns

### Command Chaining for Efficiency

**IMPORTANT: Beautiful, Efficient Command Chains**

**For Multi-Step Operations (3+ commands)**:
```bash
# Clean pattern with status indicators
(
  echo "üîç Searching for patterns..." &&
  rg "TODO|FIXME" --json | jq -r '.data.path.text' | sort -u &&
  echo "‚úÖ Found $(rg "TODO|FIXME" -c | wc -l) items" ||
  echo "‚ùå Search failed"
) 2>&1
```

**For Simple 2-Step Operations**:
```bash
# Direct chaining without elaborate formatting
npm test && npm run build
```

**Best Practices**:
- ‚úÖ Group related commands in subshells `( )`
- ‚úÖ Capture stderr when debugging needed: `2>&1`
- ‚úÖ Use emoji indicators: üîç searching, ‚úÖ success, ‚ùå failure, ‚ö†Ô∏è warning, üîß building
- ‚ùå Avoid ANSI color codes (terminal handles colors automatically)
- ‚úÖ Chain with `&&` for sequential success requirement
- ‚úÖ Use `||` for fallback handling

**WHY**: Visual clarity without complexity. Reduces token overhead. Shows progress naturally.

---

### Scripts & Automation

**IMPORTANT: Intelligent Script Creation**

**Write Scripts Automatically For**:
- Multi-file refactors (5+ files)
- Pattern replacements across codebase
- Complex validations
- Repeated operations

**Script Complexity Thresholds**:
```
< 5 files ‚Üí Direct edits
5-20 files ‚Üí Simple script with confirmation
20+ files ‚Üí Script with dry-run mode
Destructive ‚Üí Always include dry-run
```

**Backup Naming Standards**:
- Single file: `filename.ext.bak`
- Timestamped: `2025-10-22T14:30:52_filename.ext`
- Multiple files: Use ISO 8601 format consistently

**WHY**: Scripts provide repeatability, validation, and safety. Thresholds based on risk assessment.

---

## üßπ Workspace Hygiene & Cleanup

### Systematic Cleanup Culture

**CRITICAL: Clean Workspace = Clear Mind**

**Cleanup Checklist After Each Task**:
- [ ] Delete temporary scripts after confirmation
- [ ] Remove .bak files after validation
- [ ] Update affected documentation
- [ ] Clear completed todos
- [ ] Remove obsolete files
- [ ] Verify no debug code remains

**Proactive Cleanup Reminders**:
```
"‚úÖ Task complete! Quick cleanup:
- Remove temp_script.sh? (used successfully)
- Delete 3 .bak files? (changes verified)
- Update README? (new feature added)"
```

**WHY**: Clean workspace prevents confusion, reduces cognitive load, maintains professional standards.

---

## üìö Documentation & Knowledge Verification

### Documentation Search Strategy

**CRITICAL: Verify Before Assuming**

**Documentation Hierarchy**:
1. **Official Docs** ‚Üí Always check first
2. **GitHub README** ‚Üí For latest updates
3. **Migration Guides** ‚Üí For version changes
4. **Trusted Blogs** ‚Üí For patterns/examples
5. **Community** ‚Üí Last resort

**When to Search Docs**:
- Uncertainty triggers: "I think...", "probably...", "should..."
- New tool/library/version
- Unexpected behavior
- Before claiming something isn't possible

**Search Efficiency**:
```
DO: Target specific sections
DO: Use WebFetch for official docs
DO: Note version being referenced
DON'T: Read entire documentation
DON'T: Include marketing fluff in context
```

**After Verification**: "‚úì Confirmed in [source]: [specific finding]"

**WHY**: Authoritative sources prevent cascading errors. Selective reading preserves context budget.

---

## üí° Proactive Coaching

### Strategic Improvement Suggestions

**IMPORTANT: Help Without Nagging**

**Suggestion Format**:
```
üí° Tip: [specific action] ‚Üí [concrete benefit]
Example: "üí° Tip: Use Haiku agent for this search ‚Üí 3x faster, 70% cheaper"
```

**Suggestion Triggers**:
- Inefficient pattern detected
- Better tool available
- Suboptimal workflow observed
- Context getting bloated

**Limits**:
- Max 1-2 suggestions per major task
- Keep under 2 lines each
- Make actionable, not theoretical

**WHY**: User wants to improve but not be lectured. Strategic suggestions build skills over time.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment-Specific Configuration

### Custom Commands & Aliases

**IMPORTANT: Leverage User's Environment**

**Essential Context Commands**:
| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `proj-context` | Full project overview | Starting new work |
| `ai-context` | Environment summary | First interaction |
| `dotfiles-health` | Validate setup | Debugging issues |
| `env-info` | Tool versions | Compatibility checks |
| `git-summary` | Repo statistics | Understanding project |

**Before Suggesting Any Command**:
1. Check user's aliases: `alias | rg "pattern"`
2. Prefer user's shortcuts over standard commands
3. User has 200+ aliases - use them!

**Common User Aliases**:
- Navigation: `..`, `...`, `dev`, `dots`
- Git: `g` (git), `lg` (lazygit)
- Search: `search`, `searchcode`, `recent`

---

### Editor & Terminal Setup

**User's Specific Environment**:
```yaml
Editor: NeoVim (LazyVim distribution)
Quick Edit: Helix (hx command)
Terminal: Warp (AI-enhanced)
Shell: Pure Zsh (no Oh-My-Zsh)
Sessions: Zellij (just dev [name])
Remote: Tailscale + mosh (iPad‚ÜíMac)
Package Manager: Homebrew (Brewfile)
Language Versions: mise
```

---

### Dotfiles Special Considerations

**CRITICAL: Dual Nature Understanding**

**The Distinction**:
- `src/` ‚Üí Global configs affecting ALL repositories
- Root files ‚Üí Dotfiles project management only

**Git Config Confusion Prevention**:
Always ask: "Edit global git config (`src/.config/git/config`) or just this repo (`.git/config`)?"

**Key Settings**:
- Use `pushInsteadOf` not `insteadOf` (prevents 1Password popups)
- Personal data in `.local` files (never tracked)
- Bootstrap.sh is idempotent (safe to run repeatedly)

---

## üîê Quality & Security Standards

### Zero Tolerance Quality Gates

**CRITICAL: Non-Negotiable Standards**

**Never Commit**:
- ‚ùå Compiler warnings
- ‚ùå Failing tests
- ‚ùå Linter errors
- ‚ùå Debug console.log/print statements
- ‚ùå Commented-out code blocks
- ‚ùå TODO comments without issue numbers
- ‚ùå Files containing secrets

**Always Verify**:
- ‚úÖ Tests pass
- ‚úÖ Linter clean
- ‚úÖ Formatter applied
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data

**Trust Hierarchy**:
```
1. Test results > Your assumptions
2. Compiler output > Your reasoning
3. Official docs > Training data
4. Actual execution > "Should work"
```

**WHY**: Quality gates prevent compounding technical debt. Tools provide objective truth.

---

## üìù Git Workflow Standards

### Commit Messages & Pull Requests

**Conventional Commit Format**:
```
feat: Add user authentication
fix: Resolve memory leak in parser
chore: Update dependencies
docs: Improve API documentation
refactor: Simplify event handling
test: Add integration test suite
perf: Optimize database queries
```

**PR Structure**:
```markdown
## Summary
- What: Clear description of changes
- Why: Motivation and context
- How: Approach taken (if non-obvious)

## Test Plan
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Edge cases considered

## Screenshots (if UI changes)
[Before/After images]
```

---

## üéØ Definition of Done

### Completion Checklist

**Work is NOT complete until**:
- [ ] Functionality works as specified
- [ ] Zero warnings or errors
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Workspace cleaned
- [ ] Commit suggested
- [ ] User confirmed satisfaction

**Success Metrics**:
- Learning value delivered?
- Patterns reusable?
- Production ready?
- Best practices demonstrated?

---

## üîÑ Interactive Decision Making

### Presenting Options Effectively

**Format for Multiple Approaches**:
```markdown
## Available Approaches

**Option A: Quick Fix**
- Pro: Immediate resolution
- Con: Technical debt
- Time: 5 minutes

**Option B: Proper Solution**
- Pro: Long-term stability
- Con: More complex
- Time: 30 minutes

**Option C: Refactor**
- Pro: Addresses root cause
- Con: Significant effort
- Time: 2 hours

üí≠ Which approach would you prefer? (A/B/C)
```

---

## üöÄ Advanced Tool Usage

### Parallel Operations & Efficiency

**When to Use Parallel Tool Calls**:
- Multiple file reads needed
- Independent operations
- Exploration + documentation fetch
- Multiple test suites

**Example**:
```
Reading 3 config files in parallel...
[Read tool] √ó 3 simultaneously
Rather than sequential reads
```

### Background Processes

**For Long-Running Operations**:
- Use `run_in_background: true` for tests/builds
- Monitor with BashOutput tool
- Continue other work while waiting
- Report results when available

---

### File References

**ALWAYS use file:line format**:
- `src/main.rs:42` - Direct navigation
- `package.json:15-20` - Range reference
- Enables IDE navigation via click

---
